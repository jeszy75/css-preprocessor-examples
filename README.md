css-preprocessor-examples
=========================

This repository contains examples that demonstrate the features of the [Less](http://lesscss.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), and [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) CSS preprocessors.

Building the examples requires the appropriate CSS preprocessors that can be installed via `npm`. On Linux and macOS systems `npm` can be installed with the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). On Windows systems `npm` can be installed with [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Installing Less:
```shell
npm install -g less
```

Installing Dart Sass:
```shell
npm install -g sass
```

Installing Stylus:
```shell
npm install -g stylus
```

To build the examples, execute the command `make` in the subdirectories.
